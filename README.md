# storystains

Yet another Goodreads alternative. Focusing on documenting the stain a story leaves behind and why.

Heavily inspired by [zero2prod](https://zero2prod.com) and [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) in particular [CodeIdeal's implementation](https://github.com/CodeIdeal/realworld_flutter) and
[snamiki1212's actix version](https://github.com/snamiki1212/realworld-v1-rust-actix-web-diesel)
